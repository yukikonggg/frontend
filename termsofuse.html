  <h2>TERMS OF USE FOR USERS (SEARCH & BOOK)</h2>
  <p>The following terms and conditions constitute an agreement between you and Health4U Solutions Sdn Bhd (Company No. 1148648-W) (“Health4U,” “we,” or “us”), the operator of BOOKDOC.com (the “Site”) and related websites, services and mobile applications (“Application”) provided by us and in respect of which these Terms of Use are referenced (collectively, the “Services”). These terms of use (the “Terms of Use”), together with our Privacy Policy located at bookdoc.com (which is incorporated herein by reference, and collectively, this “Agreement”) govern your use of the Services.</p>
  <p>By using or otherwise accessing the Services, you agree to the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree with this Agreement, you must refrain from accessing or using the Services. Please note that we offer the Services "AS IS" and without warranties. You are required to register and authorize the use and disclosure of your information for purposes of allowing us to provide the Services and as otherwise disclosed in our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <li>
      <h3>SERVICES</h3>
      <p>The services and features of the Services enable you to make online medical appointments with participating doctors, dentists or other healthcare specialists, professionals or providers (“Healthcare Providers”) through the Site, the Application and/or the Services.</p>
      <p>Once an online medical appointment request is submitted by you through the Services, such request is considered accepted by the Healthcare Providers, until and unless you cancel the appointment or if the Healthcare Providers cancels the appointment. When the requested medical appointment is cancelled by the Healthcare Providers (“Cancelled Appointment”), we will provide notification of such Cancelled Appointment to you through the Application and/or by email. You authorise us to release the details of appointments made through the Services and of any resulting visits to the Healthcare Providers to your employer in the event that your employer is responsible to bear the cost of the medical/dental services to be provided to you.</p>
      <p>We have no control over, and cannot guarantee the availability of any Healthcare Providers at any particular time. We will not be liable for cancelled or otherwise unfulfilled appointments, or any injury resulting therefrom, or for any other injury resulting or arising from or related to the use of the Services.</p>
      <p>We use reasonable efforts to ensure that Healthcare Providers only participate in the Services if they hold all current licenses required by law to practice medicine/dental in the country. We may exclude Healthcare Providers who, in our discretion, have engaged in inappropriate or unprofessional conduct. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Healthcare Providers shall be solely responsible for all losses or damages incurred or suffered by you arising out of or in connection with your visit to the Healthcare Providers or from any goods or services of the Healthcare Providers. We are neither an agent of nor are we connected with any Healthcare Providers.</p>
      <p>No medical professional/patient relationship is created by using the Site, the Application, the Services and/or the Content (herein defined). The procedures, products, services and devices discussed and/or marketed through the Services are not applicable to all individuals, patients or all clinical situations.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to suspend and/or terminate your account at any time which will result in your inability to use the Services.</p>

    <li>
      <h3>CONTENT</h3>
      <p>You acknowledge that although some Content may be provided by individuals or other users of the Services who are in the medical profession, the provision of such Content does not create a medical professional/patient relationship, does not constitute an opinion, medical advice, diagnosis or treatment nor is it a substitute for the same. The Content is provided solely to assist you with locating a Healthcare Provider for your medical or dental needs. “Content” means content, text, data, graphics, images, photographs, video, audio, information, suggestions, guidance, and other materials provided, made available or otherwise found through the Services, the Application and/or Site, including without limitation Content provided in direct response to your questions or postings. Your use of the Content is solely at your own risk.</p>
      <p>The Content that you obtain or receive from Health4U, and its employees, contractors, partners, sponsors, advertisers, licensors or otherwise through the Services are purely for informational, educational, scheduling and pricing purposes only.</p>
      <p>We may, but have no obligation to have Content posted through the Services reviewed by our editorial personnel. It is important to note, however, that the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of any or all of the Content are not guaranteed. We will not be responsible for any errors or omissions or for the results obtained from the use of such Content.</p>
